When and Why Diwali is Celebrated?

Diwali is a Hindu festival of India celebrated on the darkest night (Amavasya) of the lunar month Kartik (According to the Hindu calendar); which usually falls in the ending October or the starting November month according to the Gregorian calendar.

Diwali or Deepawali (Sanskrit :meaning a row of deepa or lighted earthen pots) is celebrated symbolic of the victorious return of Lord Rama to his homeland Ayodhya; after an exile that lasted for 14 years and resulted in a victory of Rama over Ravana in a fierce battle fought in Lanka.

It took Rama 20 days after killing Ravana (celebrated as Dussehra) to reach Ayodhya along with Sita and Lakshman; traversing a distance of nearly 3000 kilometers.

Rama’s younger brother Bharata had also vowed to end his life if Rama didn’t return from exile. The return of Rama; therefore, brought tremendous joy for the people of Ayodhya which they celebrated welcoming him by lighting up the whole Ayodhya with earthen pots (diyas) along his path. It is this victorious return of Rama that Hindus celebrate on Kartik Amavasya each year.

In India Diwali is celebrated as a five day festival; beginning with Dhanteras, followed by Narak Chaturdashi (Choti Diwali), Lakshmi Pooja (Main Diwali), Govardhan Pooja and Bhaiduj. Each day of Diwali celebration has religious significance and a mythological story associated with it.

Paragraph on Diwali for Students – Paragraph 13 When and Why Diwali is Celebrated? Diwali is a Hindu festival of India celebrated on the darkest night (Amavasya) of the lunar month Kartik (According to the Hindu calendar); which usually falls in the ending October or the starting November month according to the Gregorian calendar. Diwali or Deepawali (Sanskrit :meaning a row of deepa or lighted earthen pots) is celebrated symbolic of the victorious return of Lord Rama to his homeland Ayodhya; after an exile that lasted for 14 years and resulted in a victory of Rama over Ravana in a fierce battle fought in Lanka. It took Rama 20 days after killing Ravana (celebrated as Dussehra) to reach Ayodhya along with Sita and Lakshman; traversing a distance of nearly 3000 kilometers. Rama’s younger brother Bharata had also vowed to end his life if Rama didn’t return from exile. The return of Rama; therefore, brought tremendous joy for the people of Ayodhya which they celebrated welcoming him by lighting up the whole Ayodhya with earthen pots (diyas) along his path. It is this victorious return of Rama that Hindus celebrate on Kartik Amavasya each year. In India Diwali is celebrated as a five day festival; beginning with Dhanteras, followed by Narak Chaturdashi (Choti Diwali), Lakshmi Pooja (Main Diwali), Govardhan Pooja and Bhaiduj. Each day of Diwali celebration has religious significance and a mythological story associated with it. Pollution on Diwali
